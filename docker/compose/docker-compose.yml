  # I like docker-compose because I can easily spin up multiple apps like a test email server alongside jenkins! for testing email notifications from jenkins (later)

    ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:8025:8025" # mailhog's web app (think test instance of gmail)
    # "127.0.0.1:1025:1025" # jenkins will use `mail:1025` to send emails, only map to host if you want to send files


## NOTES:
# Host port bindings are constrained to listening on 127.0.0.1
# - avoids external access to services
# - To open external access:
#   - Remove IP address constraint to open the flood gates
#   - Bind to another IP
